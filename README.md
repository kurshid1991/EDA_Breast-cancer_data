# EDA_Breast-cancer_data
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a dataset with benign and tumor samples. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and statistical insights to understand key patterns in the dataset.

The code focuses on classifying **benign and malignant** cells based on specific attributes describing cellular characteristics. It includes **visualizations and exploratory analysis** to support the classification process.  

## **Dataset Overview**  
The dataset originates from research conducted at the **University of Wisconsin**. It contains numerical measurements obtained from **digitized fine-needle aspirate (FNA) images** of breast cell samples.  

ðŸ“Œ **Dataset Link:** [Breast Cancer Data](https://github.com/kurshid1991/EDA_Breast-cancer_data/blob/main/breastcancerdata.csv)  

### **Key Details:**  
- **Total Samples:** 569 biopsy records  
- **Total Features:** 32  
  - 1 **ID column** (not useful for analysis)  
  - 1 **Diagnosis column** ("M" for malignant, "B" for benign)  
  - 30 **Numerical attributes** representing cell properties  

## **Feature Description**  
Each sample has measurements capturing the **mean, standard error**, and **worst (largest) values** for different cell nucleus characteristics:  

### **Cell Attributes:**
- ðŸ”µ **Radius** â€“ Average distance from the center to points on the cell perimeter  
- ðŸŸ  **Texture** â€“ Variation in grey-scale intensity levels  
- ðŸŸ¢ **Perimeter** â€“ Length around the cell boundary  
- ðŸŸ£ **Area** â€“ Total size occupied by the cell  
- ðŸ”µ **Smoothness** â€“ Degree of variation in radius lengths  
- ðŸŸ  **Compactness** â€“ Ratio of perimeterÂ² to area (indicating density)  
- ðŸŸ¢ **Concavity** â€“ Severity of concave portions in the cell boundary  
- ðŸŸ£ **Concave Points** â€“ Number of concave areas along the boundary  
- ðŸ”µ **Symmetry** â€“ Measure of how symmetrical the cell is  
- ðŸŸ  **Fractal Dimension** â€“ Complexity of the cell shape (closer to 1 = more complex)  

## **Analysis & Visualization**  
- ðŸ“Š **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand feature distributions  
- ðŸ“‰ **Visualizations** for cell attributes and correlations  
- ðŸ”¬ **Classification models** to distinguish benign vs. malignant samples
